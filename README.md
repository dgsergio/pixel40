# Pixel40 React website

This is the official website of **Pixel40\***. You can visit it at [www.pixel40.com.ar](https://www.pixel40.com.ar)

## Technology used

### React, Next.js, CSS en modules

This SPA project was created using the React library, utilizing hooks and extending its capabilities with Next.js. Next.js was chosen as it provides efficient routing and benefits from server-side rendering.

### App Architecture

The application is fully responsive, adapting to all types of devices.

The **CSS style** of the website were developed from scratch, following the css modular approach. Similar to JSX, no external code was copied.

To maintain complete control over the application, external libraries like Bootstrap or Tailwind were not utilized.

### Animations

All animations were manually created using CSS. However, for the scroll animations on the home page, the _AOS dependency_ was utilized as a convenient solution that yields visually appealing results.

### Highlights

- Implementation of the **Google Cloud Youtube API** on the video page, showcasing the channel's latest published videos.
- Creation of a custom HOOK to fetch data using JavaScript's async/await function.
- Iteration over an array using the JavaScript map method and displaying the content on the screen. This approach is used for various elements, including YouTube videos and modules in the _“Curso”_ section.
- Creation of multiple animated modals using React Context to manage state across all components. An example can be seen on the home page section, where modals for _“Reproducir Capítulo 1”_ and _“Precio y Formas de Pago”_ can be opened.
